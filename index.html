    🔥Fire is the rapid oxidation of a material (the fuel) in the exothermic chemical process of combustion, releasing heat, light, and various reaction products. At a certain point in the combustion reaction, called the ignition point, flames are produced. The flame is the visible portion of the fire. Flames consist primarily of carbon dioxide, water vapor, oxygen and nitrogen. If hot enough, the gases may become ionized to produce plasma. Depending on the substances alight, and any impurities outside, the color of the flame and the fire's intensity will be different.<p>
 			🧯Fire can be really dangerous and can cause serious injuries, destruction and even death. We must always keep these safety measures in mind to prevent these problems to happen. Remember fire can grow big in a small amount of time. </p>

			<td>🔌UNPLUG ITEMS YOU'RE NOT USING</td>
				<td>Excess electricity flowing through items in your home can always be a potential fire hazard. Things like computers, TVs, game systems and a whole lot more use electricity even when they’re not on. That means they can always experience a surge or they can just overheat and cause a fire. </td>

			<td>🌫️Never Leave Flames Unattended</td>
				<td>If you’re cooking, lighting candles, or using any other type of flame or excessive heat, you want to make sure that you’re watching it at all times. If you start cooking anything, you never want to walk away from the stove. If you start a fire in your fireplace you want to make sure you keep an eye on that as well. </td>

			<td>♨Turn Off Heated Appliances When You Leave the House</td>
				<td>Your dryer uses a lot of heat and even your dishwasher uses a decent amount of heat. Space heaters and heated blankets do as well. These are all things that you definitely don’t want to leave running when you’re not home because they could easily catch fire and cause a huge fire that you’re not home to detect. </td>

			<td>🛢️Keep Oils And Gases Away From Flames And Sparks</td>
				<td>If you keep cooking oil in your kitchen you want to keep it away from the stove or anything that could potentially spark and cause a fire. The same goes for gas that you might keep in a garage for your car, your lawnmower or anything else. </td>
